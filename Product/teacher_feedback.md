Hey, 



I think it's neat!  But maybe missing the Big Ideas...here's why:



1.) The answer is shown and the parts of the number line don't match the equation

2.) It's limited to choosing 10s and 1s (what about 2s, 3s, 5s ?)



The goal is for students to share their application personal mental math strategies pictorally.  We're using the open number line as a visual tool to show our personal strategies when solving a variety of "story structures."



Students need to be able to:



1.) Read a story problem

2.) Identify what the Unknown is 

3.) Write the equation that matches how they solve the problem

4.) Show HOW they solved it on the open number line 

5.) Talk about which mental math strategies they used ( Combos of 10, Doubles, Near Doubles, Get to 10/Pretend 10).



With your tool it only covers "Change Unknown" situations. 



See the attached document explaning all the pieces involved in this Unit.
