# Open Number Line Addition

An interactive educational app for practicing 2-digit addition using the Open Number Line strategy.

## How to Run

Since Node.js was not detected in your environment, this project is set up as a static web application. However, because it uses JavaScript modules (`type="module"`), **it cannot be run by simply double-clicking `index.html`** due to browser security restrictions (CORS).

### Options:

1.  **VS Code Live Server (Recommended)**:
    - Open this folder in VS Code.
    - Install the "Live Server" extension.
    - Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

2.  **Node.js (If installed later)**:
    - Run `npm install`
    - Run `npm run dev`

3.  **Python Simple Server**:
    - If you have Python installed, open a terminal in this folder and run:
      `python -m http.server`
    - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Features
- Visual number line with dynamic jumps (+10, +1).
